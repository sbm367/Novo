Veterinarian Dr. Liz Bales came to Novo Product Labs after a frustrating experience spending twelve months trying to get her cat feeding product from an idea to a marketable mass-manufactured item. If the pace continued as it was, it was going to take two to three years and over a million dollars to get the job done!

Within two months of partnering with NPL, the system had been taken through over 30 iterations and was ready for testing. 200 samples were manufactured and given to volunteer “trialists” to test out. After receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback, the System went up on Kickstarter (and later Indiegogo) and did $222,861 in pre-orders!

### LocoRobo: Noble cause to multi-million dollar startup in three months

Pramod Abichandani is a professor who has a passion for children and for the STEM fields. When Pramod was brainstorming to come up with a fun way to teach children how to program, he thought of robots as a possible gateway. Two years later, Pramod had several prototype models and potential investors in his idea lined up.

With the help of Novo Product labs, Pramod was able to finalize his robots and has gone on to raise a significant amount of capital to propel his vision forward of getting children all across America coding at an early age!

Manish Ingle came to Novo Product Labs with a medical product in development. His new version of an endoscopy camera was on the cutting edge of the medical space and he wanted to develop it with tools on the cutting edge of manufacturing. After a few months of design work, prototyping, and manufacturing, Manish got FDA approval for the NovaProbe, took it to market, and it has taken off!

### ButterflyMX: Idea to trade show floor in two weeks

ButterflyMX came to NPL with a deadline: they needed trade show floor models of two products, an app - based intercom system and a WIFI doorbell, within two weeks and starting from a napkin sketch. With NPL's in-house design and engineering team, fleet of 3D printers, and product development experts, those two weeks allowed for 10 design iterations and three floor models to be created just in time for the show.
